        "1. **Try it** - Since Scikit-Learn has been designed with usability in mind, your first step should be to use what you know and try figure out the answer to your own question (getting it wrong is part of the process). If in doubt, run your code.\n",
        "2. **Press SHIFT+TAB** - See you can the docstring of a function (information on what the function does) by pressing **SHIFT + TAB** inside it. Doing this is a good habit to develop. It'll improve your research skills and give you a better understanding of the library.\n",
        "3. **Search for it** - If trying it on your own doesn't work, since someone else has probably tried to do something similar, try searching for your problem. You'll likely end up in 1 of 2 places:\n",
        "    * [Scikit-Learn documentation/user guide](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/user_guide.html) - the most extensive resource you'll find for Scikit-Learn information.\n",
        "    * [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) - this is the developers Q&A hub, it's full of questions and answers of different problems across a wide range of software development topics and chances are, there's one related to your problem.\n",
        "    * [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) - ChatGPT is very good at explaining code, however, it can make mistakes. Best to verify the code it writes first before using it. Try asking \"Can you explain the following code for me? {your code here}\" and then continue with follow up questions from there. Avoid blindly trusting code you didn't write for yourself.\n",
        "    \n",
        "An example of searching for a Scikit-Learn solution might be:\n",
        "\n",
        "> \"how to tune the hyperparameters of a sklearn model\"\n",
        "\n",
        "Searching this on Google leads to the Scikit-Learn documentation for the `GridSearchCV` function: http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/grid_search.html\n",
        "\n",
        "The next steps here are to read through the documentation, check the examples and see if they line up to the problem you're trying to solve. If they do, **rewrite the code** to suit your needs, run it, and see what the outcomes are.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Ask for help** - If you've been through the above 3 steps and you're still stuck, you might want to ask your question on [Stack Overflow](https://www.stackoverflow.com) or in the ZTM Machine Learning and AI Discord channel. Be as specific as possible and provide details on what you've tried.\n",

Well, the answer is that `Doors` could be either numerical or categorical. However, I've decided to go with categorical, since where I'm from, number of doors is often a different *category* of car. For example, you can shop for 4-door cars or shop for 5-door cars (which always confused me since where's the 5th door?). However, you could experiment with treating this value as numerical or categorical, training a model on each, and then see how each model performs.\n",

And it's important to remember there's no perfect way to fill missing data (unless it's with data that should've actually been there in the first place). The methods we're using are only one of many. The techniques you use will depend heavily on your dataset. A good place to look would be searching for \"data imputation techniques\".\n",

        "* **Recall** - Indicates the proportion of actual positives which were correctly classified. A model which produces no false negatives has a recall of 1.0.\n",

And if your model perfectly predicts a range of numbers it's R^2 value would be 1. Higher is better.\n",
